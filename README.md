# System Tray Toolbar

In Windows 10, you can add toolbars, to the taskbar. 
There are three toolbars already created for you: Address, Links, and Desktop. 
You can also add your own, and reference a custom folder.

In windows 11 this feature has been removed. 
This project provides a solution that provides the same functionality.
